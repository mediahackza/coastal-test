### Climate disasters in context: portrait of a coastal city

Durban’s 2022 storm was extreme, but not unprecedented. Parts of the city were uniquely exposed because of features of its built environment and the human systems that run it. The natural landscape on which these are built played a role, as did the social and economic context in which people live, and the people themselves.

Durban is the country’s third-largest city, with a population of 3.7 million and climbing as more people are drawn from the countryside in search of a better life. The city has many well-established suburbs, but it also has a housing backlog of 387 000 units for those who can’t get into the formal property market. A third of Durban’s residents are in informal settlements, meaning some 226,000 households live in makeshift dwellings in neighbourhoods where the city struggles to keep up with service delivery demands such as water reticulation, sanitation, storm water systems, electricity provision, and garbage removal. Where these fail, a community is more at risk of flooding during a storm.

As climate impacts escalate, they will do so into this context.

Climate analysts say global heating contributed significantly to the April storm’s severity. A storm of this scale would normally happen about every 40 years, according to a report by the World Weather Attribution initiative that quantified the link between this event and human-caused carbon pollution. But with current levels of warming — already up by 1.2°C relative to pre-industrial conditions — it is more likely to be a one-in-20 year event. But as global heating speeds up, an event of this magnitude will come around even more often.

Durban needs to focus on two things to ready itself for this inevitable future, says a team of South Africa’s leading climate scientists and researchers, writing for the Institute for Security Studies in May 2022.

First, it needs effective early warning systems in the run-up to disasters. The one trialed with Quarry Road is a case in point.

Secondly, it needs to address the kind of systemic problems that shape the city’s built environment. This includes the many forces that lead to people building informal homes on the banks of a flood-prone river in the first place.
