### Palmiet River: natural ‘airbag’ protects against weather shocks

The splintered trees and solid waste that dammed the Quarry Road bridge was not an isolated incident. Culvert blockages like this are common here, forcing rivers to break their banks and gut surrounding infrastructure.

Durban is a diverse natural landscape, its steep rolling hills broken by winding river valleys which slump to a coastal plain. It is in the wettest and most humid part of the country, getting over 1,000 ml of rain in summer. Its 7,400km of streams and rivers, running through 18 catchments, are heavily damaged by urban sprawl: solid waste dumping; leaks from sewerage works and pipes; industrial pollution; sand mining; and invasive alien plants.

Heavy rainfall brings more water into a river system, flowing faster, because of the hard surfaces of the altered landscape, and the rivers clogged with alien plants and litter, storm water drainage systems and river culverts block easily, and often.

Understanding that healthy rivers and wetlands are essential to flood-proof a city, the municipality plans to roll out a community-based river restoration project, which draws on a project that’s been piloted across 300 km of river in parts of Umlazi, Inanda, Ntuzuma, and KwaMash, all less developed neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the city. The Sihlanzimvelo programme is run by the city and draws on locals, assigning groups of up to eight people to tend to their own 5 km stretch of river where they clear overgrown plants, collect litter, report pollution, and repair eroded banks.

O’Donoghue, from eThekwini’s climate protection branch, says the plan is to scale this up, city-wide. By his estimates, an investment of R7.5 billion in river restoration over two decades will prevent R1.9 billion in infrastructure damage caused by culvert blockages alone. But, he says, it could also create upward of 9,000 jobs.

A restoration project like this, applied to a river system like the Palmiet, would give a natural ‘airbag’ that would protect Quarry Road from the kind of weather shock that washed away 400 homes in the settlement in April.

The Palmiet Nature Reserve is just 15 minutes’ drive inland of Quarry Road. It is 90 ha of relatively unspoiled forests, meandering rivers that tumble over waterfalls, and grasslands higher up. A nature reserve might seem like a luxury in a city that needs land urgently for new housing. But a recent study into the value of Durban’s natural spaces — rivers, wetlands, forests, soils, and the like — estimates that its rivers give a water flow regulation service valued at R29.5 million annually.

Protecting unspoiled ecosystems and green belts — even altered ones — doesn’t just give people a beautiful place to relax and play. They give a suite of “ecosystem services” that absorb extreme weather shocks. Plants, trees in particular, are natural air conditioners that offset the urban heat island effect, which will make heat waves more lethal. Healthy wetlands and rivers — the vegetation around them, and their soil — smooth out the release of rain water into rivers, which reduces flooding, erosion, and river siltation. Dunes, estuaries, and mangroves soften the force of ocean surges during storms, buffering against erosion and wave damage to infrastructure.

Durban’s river systems slow the flow of water through the landscape, protecting against flooding and damaged infrastructure. These natural systems also prevent erosion and sediment washing into rivers, which increases flood risk and damage.
When rivers are healthy, the quality of the water is better, which reduces the cost of water treatment significantly. Investing in river system health is a win-win.
