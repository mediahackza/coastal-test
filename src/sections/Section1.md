##### Section 1

The warning came through to the Quarry Road community on the banks of the Palmiet River via a group chat platform late that Monday night.

> Don’t go to sleep. The river is rising. There’s more rain on the way. Be ready to evacuate.

Families living along this stretch of one of Durban’s 18 major rivers believe it was this warning that spared them any deaths by drowning, when floodwaters tore many of their makeshift board-and-tin homes apart.

But on 11 April 2021, a worst-case scenario was nevertheless unfolding.

Community leader Nomandla Nqanula had eyes on a nearby bridge. She snapped a photo and fired it off to the city’s disaster management team, showing that tree debris and other flotsam was snarled up against it, trapping the water’s escape. A short while later the final instruction came through from the disaster unit. It was time to get to higher ground.

It was like a disaster movie, Nqanula says, with containers from nearby shops caught in the current and slamming into dwellings. Then there was the final terrifying escape as she and her neighbours formed a human chain to cross the nearby M19 highway which was disappearing under the fast-flowing water.

When the sun rose on Tuesday, there was nothing but a hole gouged into the bank where Nqanula’s home had stood. Like many, everything she owned had been washed away. Their lives, at least, had been spared.

Other communities in the eThekwini municipality on South Africa’s east coast weren’t so lucky.
