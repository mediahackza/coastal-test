##### Section 2

By the time President Cyril Ramaphosa called a state of emergency on April 19, at least 435 people were dead and 54 were missing. Thousands had lost their homes and businesses. Roads and bridges were torn away, communications knocked out, sewerage works gutted, and swathes of water and power grids destroyed. The initial damage was estimated at R17 billion, although the final bill might run even higher than R25 billion, eThekwini’s senior manager in the climate protection branch, Dr Sean O’Donoghue said in an online address a month after the disaster.

It was the perfect storm: not just the weather system, but the physical shape of the city which it hit. Durban is a complicated sprawl of old settlements and new; concrete-and-steel standing alongside shantytowns; where infrastructure and service delivery are steps behind the needs of its fast-growing population; where hilly terrain is shot through with boom-and-bust rivers.

No coastal city – no matter how developed – will escape the extreme events coming with global heating. While Global South cities are uniquely vulnerable, insights from the storms that brought severe inland river flooding in Durban in April 2022 shows how they can brace for future impacts.
