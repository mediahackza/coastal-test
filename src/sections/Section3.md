### Early Warning

Resilience is the ability to bounce back after a shock like this, be it a community, person, or system.

That night at Quarry Road, the city was piloting a novel approach to its existing early warning system that, if it worked, could help other flood-exposed communities not only survive these inevitable and escalating events, but recover better.

But the first red flag of what was to come arrived months before the April storm.

The South African Weather Service (SAWS) warned that the ongoing La Niña weather cycle — a years-long natural event which brings higher-than-average rainfall — had waterlogged the soils ahead of the 2022 rainy season. The saturated ground wouldn’t be able to hold much more water, increasing the likelihood of flooding.

Then, on 10 April, SAWS issued a Level 9 weather warning on its 1-to-10 alert system. It had only issued a Level 10 warning once before, in January 2021 when tropical storm Eloise landed on South Africa’s coast, affecting neighbouring countries, and hitting Mozambique particularly hard.

The short-range forecast that April predicted a cut-off low, which would bring a high chance of dangerous flooding, kicked eThekwini’s Disaster Management and Emergency Control Unit’s protocols into play.

In Quarry Road, the community-based early warning system that was in the making for eight years was now being tested in real time. This meant marrying the city-wide forecast with the fine-grained details of the catchment that feeds into the Palmiet River.

Information began flying across a digital group chat platform that allowed the various parties — the city’s disaster management unit, the city’s senior climate scientist, a university academic who helped design the system, and volunteers within the community — to stay in touch.

The city’s catchment manager began monitoring the rain gauge upriver of Quarry Road, knowing from hydrology models that it would take 40 minutes for water to travel from there to the Quarry Road community.

The water had already risen to a dangerous 2 m and more was on the way.

When Nqanula reported the bridge blockage, the disaster team escalated the response. Time to evacuate.

It was 11pm. She had just enough time to grab her ID and phone.

The system, says University of KwaZulu Natal’s School of Built Environment and Development Studies geographer Catherine Sutherland, who is part of the system’s design and piloting, is novel in a few ways.

Rather than relying only on a blunt catchment-wide weather forecast, this zooms in on local-scale conditions and real-time data. It uses SAWS’s new impact-based weather alert system which goes beyond simply giving the details of how much rain might fall, or what wind speeds to expect, but flags the likely damage these might cause to the built environment, explains SAWS chief forecaster Kevin Rae.

It then draws on individuals in the affected community to get the most complete picture of the event as it unfolds.

This kind of early warning system is just one lever in the complicated machinery of a city system in an emergency situation like this, and a good example of how it can build better resilience.
